<!-- 🎵 Song Lyrics -->

<h1>Cloudbusting - Kate Bush</h1>
​​<!-- She sings about someone who treats her inconsistently 
and makes her feel high highs and low lows, so she 
suppresses her love for them and tries to move on. -->
<p>You're like my yo-yo</p>
<p>That glowed in the dark</p>
<p>What made it special</p>
<p>Made it dangerous</p>
<p>So I bury it</p>
<p>And forget</p>
